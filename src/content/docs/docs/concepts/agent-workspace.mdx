The **Agent Workspace** is the directory where the agent runs, stores files, and manages its "home". It serves as the persistent filesystem for the agent across restarts.

## Default Location

By default, the workspace is located at:

*   **Linux/macOS**: `~/.openclaw/workspace`
*   **Windows**: `%USERPROFILE%\.openclaw\workspace`

You can verify the location by running:

```bash
openclaw config get agent.workspace
```

## Configuration

You can override the workspace location in your `config.json` (or via environment variables).

```json5
// config.json
{
  agent: {
    // Custom workspace path
    workspace: "/var/lib/openclaw/workspace"
  }
}
```

### Environment Variables

*   `OPENCLAW_WORKSPACE`: Overrides the workspace path.

## Structure

A typical workspace contains:

```text
workspace/
├── .git/               # (Optional) Git history for backup
├── memories/           # Vector store or memory files
├── sessions/           # Session-specific data
├── skills/             # Local skills/tools
├── storage/            # General file storage for agents
└── temp/               # Temporary scratch space
```

## File Map & Access

Agents usually have read/write access to this directory.
*   **Read**: The agent can read any file in the workspace.
*   **Write**: The agent can create or modify files here.

### Security Note
The agent is **sandboxed** to this directory (logically). While the underlying process might have OS-level permissions, the OpenClaw runtime restricts high-level file operations to the workspace to prevent accidental modification of system files.

## Backup Strategy

Since the workspace contains all your agent's state (memories, custom skills, session logs), it is crucial to back it up.

### Git Backup
OpenClaw has built-in support for using Git to version the workspace.

1.  Initialize a git repo in the workspace:
    ```bash
    cd ~/.openclaw/workspace
    git init
    ```
2.  Configure a remote (e.g., private GitHub repo):
    ```bash
    git remote add origin git@github.com:username/my-agent-workspace.git
    ```
3.  OpenClaw can be configured to auto-commit changes (feature availability depends on version).

### Manual Backup
Simply archive the directory:
```bash
tar -czvf openclaw-backup.tar.gz ~/.openclaw/workspace
```

## Moving to a New Machine

To migrate your agent:
1.  **Stop** the OpenClaw service.
2.  **Copy** the entire `workspace` directory to the new machine.
3.  **Install** OpenClaw on the new machine.
4.  **Point** the config to the copied workspace.
5.  **Start** the service.
