# WhatsApp (web channel)

Status: **Stable** (WhatsApp Web via Baileys). The Gateway owns the session(s).

<Aside type="note">
For architectural details and multi-account setups, see the [WhatsApp Channel Guide](/docs/channels/whatsapp/).
</Aside>

OpenClaw connects to WhatsApp using the **Baileys** library, simulating a WhatsApp Web client. This allows your agent to reply to messages, manage groups, and act as a personal assistant directly within WhatsApp.

## Quick Setup

<Steps>

1.  **Prepare a Phone Number**
    Use a separate phone number if possible (recommended) or your personal number.

2.  **Configure OpenClaw**
    Add the WhatsApp configuration to `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`.

    ```json5
    {
      channels: {
        whatsapp: {
          enabled: true,
          dmPolicy: "allowlist",
          allowFrom: ["+15551234567"] // Your personal number
        }
      }
    }
    ```

3.  **Start the Gateway**
    Run the gateway to initialize the connection.
    ```bash
    openclaw gateway run
    ```

4.  **Scan QR Code**
    The gateway will print a QR code to the terminal (or logs).
    - Open WhatsApp on your phone.
    - Go to **Settings** > **Linked Devices** > **Link a Device**.
    - Scan the QR code.

</Steps>

## Configuration Strategy

<Aside type="tip" title="Best Practice">
For the best experience, use a **dedicated phone number** for your bot.
</Aside>

### Option A: Dedicated Number (Recommended)
Use a spare Android phone or an eSIM on your main device.
- **Pros**: Clean routing, no "self-chat" quirks, distinct identity.
- **Setup**: Install WhatsApp (or WhatsApp Business) on the spare device/profile. Link OpenClaw to this account.

### Option B: Personal Number (Fallback)
Run OpenClaw on your own main number.
- **Pros**: No extra hardware/SIM needed.
- **Cons**: You have to message *yourself* (Note to Self) to talk to the bot.
- **Quirks**: You will see the bot's replies as if you sent them.

## Advanced Configuration

```json5
{
  channels: {
    whatsapp: {
      enabled: true,
      // Who can talk to the bot?
      dmPolicy: "allowlist", // "allowlist" (strict) or "pairing" (open)
      allowFrom: ["+15551234567"],
      
      // Admin users (can run privileged commands)
      adminUsers: ["+15551234567"],
      
      // Session storage (defaults to ~/.openclaw/workspace/sessions/whatsapp)
      sessionDir: "/path/to/custom/session" 
    }
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Connection Issues">
    - **QR Code Loop**: If the QR code keeps regenerating, ensure your phone has a stable internet connection.
    - **Disconnects**: WhatsApp Web sessions can time out. Restart the gateway to refresh the session.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Message Routing">
    - **No Reply**: Check `dmPolicy`. If set to `allowlist`, ensure your number is in `allowFrom` (include country code, e.g., `+1...`).
    - **Group Chats**: By default, the bot may not reply in groups unless mentioned or configured otherwise.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
