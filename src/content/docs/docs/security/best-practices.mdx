# Security 🔒

## Quick check: `openclaw security audit`

Run this regularly (especially after changing config or exposing network surfaces):

```bash
openclaw security audit
openclaw security audit --deep
openclaw security audit --fix
```

It flags common footguns (Gateway auth exposure, browser control exposure, elevated allowlists, filesystem permissions).

`--fix` applies safe guardrails:
- Tighten `groupPolicy="open"` to `groupPolicy="allowlist"` (and per-account variants) for common channels.
- Turn `logging.redactSensitive="off"` back to `"tools"`.
- Tighten local perms (`~/.openclaw` → `700`, config file → `600`, plus common state files).

## Core Principles

Running an AI agent with shell access on your machine is... *spicy*. Here’s how to not get pwned.

OpenClaw is both a product and an experiment: you’re wiring frontier-model behavior into real messaging surfaces and real tools. **There is no “perfectly secure” setup.** The goal is to be deliberate about:
- who can talk to your bot
- where the bot is allowed to act
- what the bot can touch

Start with the smallest access that still works, then widen it as you gain confidence.

## What the audit checks (high level)

- **Inbound access** (DM policies, group policies, allowlists): can strangers trigger the bot?
- **Tool blast radius** (elevated tools + open rooms): could prompt injection turn into shell/file/network actions?
- **Network exposure** (Gateway bind/auth, Tailscale Serve/Funnel).
- **Browser control exposure** (remote nodes, relay ports, remote CDP endpoints).
- **Local disk hygiene** (permissions, symlinks, config includes, “synced folder” paths).
- **Plugins** (extensions exist without an explicit allowlist).
- **Model hygiene** (warn when configured models look legacy; not a hard block).

## Credential storage map

Use this when auditing access or deciding what to back up:

- **WhatsApp**: `~/.openclaw/credentials/whatsapp/<accountId>/creds.json`
- **Telegram bot token**: config/env or `channels.telegram.tokenFile`
- **Pairing allowlists**: `~/.openclaw/credentials/<channel>-allowFrom.json`
- **Model auth profiles**: `~/.openclaw/agents/<agentId>/agent/auth-profiles.json`

## Security Audit Checklist

When the audit prints findings, treat this as a priority order:

1. **Anything “open” + tools enabled**: lock down DMs/groups first (pairing/allowlists), then tighten tool policy/sandboxing.
2. **Public network exposure** (LAN bind, Funnel, missing auth): fix immediately.
3. **Browser control remote exposure**: treat it like operator access (tailnet-only, pair nodes deliberately, avoid public exposure).
4. **Permissions**: make sure state/config/credentials/auth are not group/world-readable.
5. **Plugins/extensions**: only load what you explicitly trust.
6. **Model choice**: prefer modern, instruction-hardened models for any bot with tools.
