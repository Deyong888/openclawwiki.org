# Channel troubleshooting

Start with:

```bash
openclaw doctor
openclaw channels status --probe
```

`channels status --probe` prints warnings when it can detect common channel misconfigurations, and includes small live checks (credentials, some permissions/membership).

## Channels
- Discord: [/docs/channels/discord#troubleshooting](/docs/channels/discord#troubleshooting)
- Telegram: [/docs/channels/telegram#troubleshooting](/docs/channels/telegram#troubleshooting)
- WhatsApp: [/docs/channels/whatsapp#troubleshooting-quick](/docs/channels/whatsapp#troubleshooting-quick)

## Telegram quick fixes
- Logs show `HttpError: Network request for 'sendMessage' failed` or `sendChatAction` → check IPv6 DNS. If `api.telegram.org` resolves to IPv6 first and the host lacks IPv6 egress, force IPv4 or enable IPv6. See [/docs/channels/telegram#troubleshooting](/docs/channels/telegram#troubleshooting).
- Logs show `setMyCommands failed` → check outbound HTTPS and DNS reachability to `api.telegram.org` (common on locked-down VPS or proxies).
