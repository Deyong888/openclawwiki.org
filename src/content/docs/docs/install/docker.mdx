# Docker (optional)

Docker is **optional**. Use it only if you want a containerized gateway or to validate the Docker flow.

## Is Docker right for me?

- **Yes**: you want an isolated, throwaway gateway environment or to run OpenClaw on a host without local installs.
- **No**: you’re running on your own machine and just want the fastest dev loop. Use the normal install flow instead.
- **Sandboxing note**: agent sandboxing uses Docker too, but it does **not** require the full gateway to run in Docker.

## Requirements

- Docker Desktop (or Docker Engine) + Docker Compose v2
- Enough disk for images + logs

## Containerized Gateway (Docker Compose)

### Quick start (recommended)

From repo root:

```bash
./docker-setup.sh
```

This script:
- builds the gateway image
- runs the onboarding wizard
- prints optional provider setup hints
- starts the gateway via Docker Compose
- generates a gateway token and writes it to `.env`

Optional env vars:
- `OPENCLAW_DOCKER_APT_PACKAGES` — install extra apt packages during build
- `OPENCLAW_EXTRA_MOUNTS` — add extra host bind mounts
- `OPENCLAW_HOME_VOLUME` — persist `/home/node` in a named volume

After it finishes:
- Open `http://127.0.0.1:18789/` in your browser.
- Paste the token into the Control UI (Settings → token).

It writes config/workspace on the host:
- `~/.openclaw/`
- `~/.openclaw/workspace`

### Manual flow (compose)

```bash
docker build -t openclaw:local -f Dockerfile .
docker compose run --rm openclaw-cli onboard
docker compose up -d openclaw-gateway
```
