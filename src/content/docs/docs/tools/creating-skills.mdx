# Developing Custom Skills 🛠️

**Skills** are the primary way to extend OpenClaw's capabilities. Whether you want to integrate a private API, automate a specific workflow, or add a new tool, Skills provide a standardized way to package instructions and functionality.

## What is a Skill?

A Skill is simply a directory containing a `SKILL.md` file.
- **Metadata**: YAML frontmatter defines the skill's name and description.
- **Instructions**: The Markdown body tells the LLM *when* and *how* to use the skill.
- **Tools**: Skills can define their own tools (via scripts) or use existing system tools.

## Prerequisites

- **OpenClaw/Moltbot Installed**: You need a running Gateway.
- **Workspace Access**: You must have access to the `~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/` directory.

## Step-by-Step Guide

<Steps>

1.  **Create the Skill Directory**
    Skills typically live in your workspace. Create a new folder for your skill.
    ```bash
    mkdir -p ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/hello-world
    ```

2.  **Create `SKILL.md`**
    Create a `SKILL.md` file in that directory. This is the brain of your skill.

    ```markdown
    ---
    name: hello_world
    description: A simple skill that says hello.
    ---

    # Hello World Skill

    When the user asks for a greeting or says "hello", use the `echo` tool (or just respond directly) to say:
    "Hello from your custom skill! 🚀"
    ```

3.  **Add Functionality (Optional)**
    You can instruct the agent to use existing tools like `bash`, `browser`, or `web_fetch`.
    *Example: A skill that checks Hacker News.*

    ```markdown
    # Hacker News Checker
    To check Hacker News:
    1. Use `web_fetch` to get `https://news.ycombinator.com`.
    2. Summarize the top 3 stories.
    ```

4.  **Refresh Skills**
    Tell your agent to "refresh skills" or simply restart the Gateway. OpenClaw watches the skills directory and will auto-discover the new addition.

5.  **Test It**
    Send a message to your agent.
    > "Say hello using your new skill."

</Steps>

## Best Practices

<Aside type="tip">
**Be Concise**: Instruct the model on *what* to do, not *how to be an AI*. The model already knows how to think; it just needs to know your specific business logic.
</Aside>

- **Clear Triggers**: Define exactly when the skill should be used (e.g., "Use this skill when the user asks about X").
- **Safety**: If your skill uses `bash`, be extremely careful. Do not allow the model to execute arbitrary code from user input unless necessary.
- **Modularity**: Keep skills focused on a single domain (e.g., "Calendar Skill", "Deployment Skill").

## Advanced: Adding Custom Scripts

You can include scripts (Node.js, Python, Bash) in your skill directory and instruct the agent to run them.

*Example structure:*
```
hello-world/
├── SKILL.md
└── greet.js
```

*SKILL.md:*
```markdown
To greet the user, run `node {{skillPath}}/greet.js`.
```
(Note: `{{skillPath}}` is a placeholder you can manually resolve or instruct the agent to find relative to the skill file).

## Sharing Skills

Once you've built a useful skill, you can share it with the community or your team.
- **ClawdHub**: [ClawdHub](https://clawdhub.com) is the official registry for shared skills.
- **Git**: Commit your `skills/` directory to a private repo for team synchronization.

## Configuration

To manage where OpenClaw looks for skills, see [Skills Config](/docs/tools/skills-config).
