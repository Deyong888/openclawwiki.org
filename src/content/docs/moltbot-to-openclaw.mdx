OpenClaw (formerly Moltbot/Clawdbot) is moving fast. This guide covers how to safely migrate your existing installation to the latest version (v2026.1.30+).

## Before You Start

:::caution
Always backup your data before performing a major upgrade.
:::

Snapshot your current configuration and workspace:
- **Config**: `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` (or `~/.moltbot/moltbot.json`)
- **Credentials**: `~/.openclaw/credentials/`
- **Workspace**: `~/.openclaw/workspace`

## Method 1: Automated Update (Preferred)

The easiest way to update is to re-run the installer. It detects existing installs, upgrades in place, and runs `openclaw doctor` automatically.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://openclaw.ai/install.sh | bash
```

**Notes:**
- Add `--no-onboard` if you don’t want the onboarding wizard to run again.
- This works for both **global** and **source** installs.

## Method 2: Global Install Update

If you installed via `npm` or `pnpm` globally, you can update using your package manager.

**Using npm:**
```bash
npm i -g openclaw@latest
```

**Using pnpm:**
```bash
pnpm add -g openclaw@latest
```

After updating, run the doctor command to ensure everything is migrated correctly:

```bash
openclaw doctor
openclaw gateway restart
```

## Method 3: Source Install Update

If you are running from a git clone, use the built-in update command:

```bash
openclaw update
```

This command will:
1. Switch to the selected channel.
2. Fetch and rebase against upstream.
3. Rebuild dependencies and the Control UI.
4. Run `openclaw doctor`.
5. Restart the gateway.

## Verification

After updating, verify your installation status:

```bash
openclaw --version
openclaw health
```

### New in v2026.1.30
- **Per-Agent Models**: Check model status with `openclaw gateway status --agent`.
- **Shell Completion**: Run `openclaw completion` to set up tab completion for Zsh/Bash/PowerShell.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:
1. Run **`openclaw doctor`** - it fixes most common config and migration issues.
2. Check the logs: `openclaw logs --follow`.
3. If necessary, you can rollback to a specific version (see [Updating Docs](/docs/install/updating)).
